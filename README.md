# Project 2 Proposal
## Description
Using and API for the game Age of Empires 2, I will make a site that lists all of the civilizations you can play, and when you click on them, you will get details about the
features that are unique to each one.

## Wireframes

**MVP User Stories**
  - User should be able to see cards with each civilization on main page
  - User should be able to click on any card and it should expand with more details
  - User should be able to click on a "more into" button and be taken to a more detailed page
  - User should be able to click on navigation to return to the main page
  **MVP Stretch**
  - User should be able to choose between civ, units, buildings, and tech in nav
